Storing the memory address to the pointer
Queue lines things up for a certain purpose

We need a linked list in our binary tree
We need a new node
Curnode

Remove node is void
Pop returns address to a node
Push want it to add a node

How do you know it works
For queues self confidence, test in valgrind that the nodes are reachable
Peek will show the item at the end of the queue without removing it
.length for the queues to return how many items are in the line
Get the address in the tree

Object oriented programming
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism

Clean code smells code
non -good it does not smell good


No clear way of creating the code
We want to create a new struct with QNODE
Node and NODE are different
Ideas doesn’t mean it is the best

Want push and pop functions
We aren’t declaring any of our functions

Nodes have to be declared before the function declarations
That is why they have to be added after the typedef system

Valgrind makes distinction between definitely lost and indirectly lost
This is to allow the programmer to identify the error
