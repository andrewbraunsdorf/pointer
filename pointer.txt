Add address of each node
Add 1st level, check level to see if it is the line we are modifying
To see if they are level two nodes
Need to add increment to counter,
Adding level as new part of the struct
Push function would require a level
Modify struct, push, and pop...not pop full node but the q*

QNODE Struct have node, level, next
Push you are going to send it a level, node * int level
Pop needs to return the whole QNODE * instead of the NODE
Pop needs whole QNODE, which means you cannot send it via pop alone
Need a copy and send it back
