Add address of each node
Add 1st level, check level to see if it is the line we are modifying
To see if they are level two nodes
Need to add increment to counter,
Adding level as new part of the struct
Push function would require a level
Modify struct, push, and pop...not pop full node but the q*

QNODE Struct have node, level, next
Push you are going to send it a level, node * int level
Pop needs to return the whole QNODE * instead of the NODE
Pop needs whole QNODE, which means you cannot send it via pop alone
Need a copy and send it back

Start at 10
Int level to 1, start on level 0 but need to go and look to level 1
Variable what we are adding to the node
Add children but need address and level,
Adds address of child level

Print function

Then we pop, we can check are we are on a new level
If popped level == level then we are on a new level,
Increment ++;
Then print \n.  We can skip or

Storing the memory address to the pointer
Queue lines things up for a certain purpose

We need a linked list in our binary tree
We need a new node
Curnode

Remove node is void
Pop returns address to a node
Push want it to add a node

How do you know it works
For queues self confidence, test in valgrind that the nodes are reachable
Peek will show the item at the end of the queue without removing it
.length for the queues to return how many items are in the line
Get the address in the tree


Object oriented programming
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism

Clean code smells code
non -good it does not smell good


No clear way of creating the code
We want to create a new struct with QNODE
Node and NODE are different
Ideas doesn’t mean it is the best

Want push and pop functions
We aren’t declaring any of our functions

Nodes have to be declared before the function declarations
That is why they have to be added after the typedef system

Valgrind makes distinction between definitely lost and indirectly lost
This is to allow the programmer to identify the error
